% TODO: Explicitly tie my experience to the role

Dear Weights \& Biases hiring team,

I'm a software engineer with a mathematics background who has over 12 years of experience in C++ and MATLAB along with significant experience with Python and TypeScript. Working in technical and scientific computing allowed me to build tools that helped engineers, scientists, and researchers achieve their goals. My experience delivering tested and performant software, leading a team, collaborating with cross-functional teams, learning new skills on the job, and driving product direction gives me a valuable base and broad insight that I think would be valuable in a high-impact role at Weights \& Biases.

As a senior software engineer, senior team lead, and manager on the MATLAB Coder team at MathWorks, my team and I worked hard to satisfy our users' needs to write MATLAB code, compile it to C++, and deploy their algorithms to standalone hardware while achieving excellent performance. This role gave me direct insight into the needs of scientists and engineers working in their domains. I would love to continue on that path by building tooling that accelerates the workflow and efficiency of your users in the machine learning space.

Having a background in mathematics, experience working on numerical software, exposure to multiple programming languages \& technologies, and an interest in growing my machine learning skills afford me the ability to be an asset to your teams at Weights \& Biases.

All the best,
