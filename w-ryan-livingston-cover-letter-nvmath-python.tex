Dear Sergey and hiring team,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Math Libraries Engineer - Python APIs role at NVIDIA that Xi Wang and Yancheng Zheng forwarded to me on LinkedIn. My experience working for MathWorks allowed me to serve users working in a high-level environment needing to access cutting-edge performance and functionality. I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to bring my experience and user focus to the broad audience you have at NVIDIA while pushing the boundaries of technology.

As a senior software engineer, senior team lead, and manager on the MATLAB Coder team at MathWorks my team and I enhanced the ability for users to write MATLAB code, compile it to C++, and deploy their algorithms to standalone hardware while achieving excellent performance. During my time there I worked to expand the compiler's support for the MATLAB language and libraries by adding 64-bit integer support and developing a sparse matrix type for the compiler. I worked to improve the performance of the generated code by making it call high-performance libraries like BLAS and LAPACK, reducing runtimes up to 40\%.

Understanding and engaging with users' needs to deliver meaningful functionality is a top priority and passion of mine. While driving product direction, I prioritized improving ease of use, optimizing generated code, and expanding MATLAB support in code generation for our users. I would love the opportunity to bring my experience and passion to the nvmath-python team and work with you to continue serving the scientific computing community.

All the best,
