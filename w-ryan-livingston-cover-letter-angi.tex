% TODO: Explicitly tie my experience to the role

Dear Angi hiring team,

I'm a software engineer with over 11 years of experience who loves learning new technologies and would love the opportunity to interview for your team! My experience delivering tested and performant software, leading a team, collaborating with cross-functional teams, learning new skills on the job, and driving product direction gives me a valuable base and broad insight that I think would be valuable in a high-impact role at Angi.

As a senior software engineer, senior team lead, and manager on the MATLAB Coder team at MathWorks, my team and I worked hard to satisfy our users' needs to write MATLAB code, compile it to C++, and deploy their algorithms to standalone hardware while achieving excellent performance. We worked in a central team that collaborated with many in the company. That allowed us to deliver on both internal needs within MathWorks and external needs of our users. My management roles allowed me to provide technical and professional mentorship to newer team members, interns, and collaborators.

Beyond my major responsibilities, I seized opportunities to learn by delivering significant internal tooling projects using Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. The possibility of delving into the varied technology stack at Angi and growing my knowledge is exciting! I'd love the opportunity to bring my enthusiasm, customer focus, and passion for quality software to Angi to better serve your users in finding and providing quality home services.

All the best,
