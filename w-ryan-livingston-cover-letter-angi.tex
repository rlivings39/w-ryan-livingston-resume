% TODO: Explicitly tie my experience to the role

Dear Angi hiring team,

I'm a software engineer with over 11 years of experience who loves learning new technologies and would love the opportunity to interview for your team! My major responsibilities have been building enterprise software using C++ and MATLAB and driving the product direction of that software. Beyond that core work, I delivered significant functionality with Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. My past roles allowed me to own end-to-end feature delivery, interact closely with users \& user-facing engineers, collaborate throughout a large organization, drive product direction for a foundational product, and deliver well-tested performant code to serve users.

As a senior software engineer, senior team lead, and manager on the MATLAB Coder team at MathWorks, my team and I worked hard to satisfy our users' needs to write MATLAB code, compile it to C++, and deploy their algorithms to standalone hardware while achieving excellent performance. We worked in a central team that collaborated with many in the company. That allowed us to deliver on both internal needs within MathWorks and external needs of our users. My management roles allowed me to provide technical and professional mentorship to newer team members, interns, and collaborators.

The possibility of delving into the varied technology stack at Angi and growing my knowledge excites me! I'd love the opportunity to bring my enthusiasm, customer focus, and passion for quality software to Angi to better serve your users in finding and providing quality home services.

All the best,
